Show or hide any WordPress block with ease. Schedule when blocks should be visible. Restrict blocks to specific screen sizes, user roles, and more.

== Description ==

Effortlessly create dynamic content in WordPress that will increase conversions, enhance the user experience and improve your workflow.

With this **no-code** solution, control which blocks are visible on your website and who can see them. Schedule content to show or hide at a specific time. Display exclusive promotions to your customers or members. Restrict blocks to specific user roles, screen sizes, query strings, ACF fields, WP Fusion tags, and more.

Built exclusively for the WordPress Editor (Gutenberg), Block Visibility is designed to work with **any** WordPress block. This includes Core, third-party blocks, and even block-based widgets.

=== Create Conditional Blocks in Seconds! ===

Work directly in the WordPress Editor with blocks you're already familiar with. There is no external editor or new interface to learn. In a matter of seconds, you can transform static blocks into conditional and personalized content.

It takes just **3 simple steps**:

1. Create your content using **any** WordPress block.
2. Select the desired visibility conditions.
3. Save the page/post and marvel at the results!

=== Free Features ===

**Visibility Controls** determine whether a block should be visible to users on the front end of your website. Free controls include:

* **Hide** blocks from all users.
* **Schedule** when content should be visible using a start and end date/time.
* Conditionally display blocks based on **screen size** (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile, and more)
* Only show blocks to **logged-in** users.
* Only show blocks to **logged-out** users.
* Only show blocks to users with **specific roles** (Administrator, Subscriber, Customer, Member, etc.)
* Only show blocks to **specific users**. Great for personalization.
* Show or hide dynamic blocks based on **URL query strings**. Great for marketing campaigns!
* **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF):** Control the visibility of block content based on [ACF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/) fields.

**PLUS: Powerful Settings** allow you to customize Block Visibility to your needs or those of your clients.

* Globally disable any visibility control.

* Temporarily hide seasonal content on your website rather than having to delete it.
* Schedule time-sensitive promotional content or event information to display automatically.
* Show or hide specific content on desktops, tablets, or mobile devices.
* Restrict content, so it's only visible to your customers, members or subscribers.
* Display messaging to logged-out users, encouraging them to subscribe to your blog.
* Create unique marketing campaigns using query string parameters to display personalized messaging ([See it in action](https://www.blockvisibilitywp.com?bv_query=example))

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who should use Block Visibility? =
Block Visibility is a powerful yet simple plugin that gives marketing agencies, bloggers, eCommerce websites, and small business owners the power to conditionally show or hide blocks on their websites. The need to hide Gutenberg blocks varies. Whether you need to restrict content to specific users like members or launch a promotional campaign at a particular time with block scheduling, the applications are endless.

If you need dynamic content control on your WordPress website, you need Block Visibility.

= Is there a pro/premium version of Block Visibility? =
Absolutely! [Block Visibility Pro](https://www.blockvisibilitywp.com/?bv_query=readme&utm_source=block_visibility&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme) available as an optional paid add-on and includes advanced functionality and third-party integrations.

= Do conditional visibility controls really work with any block? (What is Full Control Mode?) =
Yes! However, not all block types are enabled by default. Controls are only provided to blocks that can be added directly to a page/post by the block inserter. Therefore, some specialized blocks, such as child blocks, are not included by default. An example is the individual Column block that is part of the larger Columns block.

That said, you can enable Full Control Mode in the plugin settings. This setting removes all restrictions and adds conditional visibility controls to every block. You probably will not need Full Control Mode in most cases, but it is there if you do!

Furthermore, while this plugin is designed to be compatible with all blocks, the WordPress ecosystem is ever-expanding. If you find a conflict with a specific block, please let us know in the plugin support forum, and we will investigate. We are committed to bringing visibility block controls to **every** Gutenberg block.

= Can Block Visibility be used with any WordPress theme? =
Yup, this plugin is not theme-specific. You just need to run the latest WordPress version and use a theme that supports the block Editor. This plugin provides zero functionality to the Classic Editor.

= Will more conditional visibility controls be added in the future? =
Yes, and if you have a specific idea of what you would like to see, please submit a feature request in the plugin support forum on WordPress.org.

= Does this plugin work in the Site Editor (Full Site Editing)? =
As of version 1.4.0, Block Visibility is supported in the Site Editor, which is available when using a block theme. We are committed to ensuring 100% compatibility with all Full Site Editing features. Please let us know in the plugin support forum if you find bugs or compatibility issues.

= Does Block Visibility work with Elementor and other page builders? =
No. Block Visibility is designed specifically for the WordPress block Editor and therefore does not work on pages that the Elementor editor or another page builder controls. So long as you edit native WordPress "block" content, Block Visibility will work.

= Is block visibility controlled using CSS? =
Visibility is controlled primarily on the server, so if a block should be hidden based on the set block controls, it will not even be rendered. This functionality ensures the plugin does not load any additional resources on the front end of your site, thereby optimizing performance.

The **one exception** to this is the Screen Size block controls. Visibility by screen size requires the use of CSS. This CSS is loaded to the front end of your site if, and only if, these controls are enabled. You can opt to disable this CSS and add the necessary styles yourself. Visit the plugin [Knowledge Base](https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-screen-size-control/?bv_query=readme&utm_source=block_visibility&utm_medium=plugin&utm_campaign=readme) to learn more.

* Fixed error where scheduling controls were still active on the frontend when disabled in the plugin settings.

= 1.4.3 - 2021-02-06 =

**Fixed**

* Error that occurred when plugin assets were enqueued on incorrect admin pages. Improved logic now dequeues assets on any admin page without the Block Editor. Thanks @gsarig for catching this!

= 1.4.2 - 2021-01-19 =

**Fixed**

* Error that occurred when the plugin was deleted.
* Contextual indicator border not displaying on placeholder blocks (e.g. the Shortcode Block)

= 1.4.1 - 2021-01-18 =

**Added**

* The ability to disabled scheduling at the block level without having to remove the start and end date/times.
* The `blockVisibility` "supports" variable to all blocks types that have visibility enabled. This provide a more consistent method for detecting whether a block should have visibility controls or not.

**Changed**

* The contextual indicator icons have been updated and are now more legible.
* Refactored the scheduling controls.
* Updated the Visibility by Role labels to be more consistent with standard WordPress labeling and nomenclature.

**Deprecated**

* The `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` properties of the `blockVisibility` attribute have been deprecated. All new blocks will use the new `scheduling` property.

**Removed**

* Visibility block attribute defaults in an effort to declutter block markup when only a few settings are enabled.

**Fixed**

* Some third-party blocks were not receiving visibility controls when they should have, notably Jetpack blocks, due to the way their block JS is enqueued.

= 1.4.0 - 2021-01-01 =

**Upgrade Warning**

For the long-term maintainability of the Block Visibility plugin, changes to the underlying file structure were needed in version 1.4.0. Therefore, when you upgrade from version 1.3.0 or lower, the plugin will deactivate and you will receive an error message. But don't worry, simply re-activate Block Visibility and you are good to go.

This is an unfortunate issue that will occur only once. We apologize for any inconvenience that this causes, but trust that this change better positions the plugin for many exciting enhancements in the future!
